# Functionnal types

## Purpose

Exercice aims to dive in functions (simple, hight order functions, etc) 

## Todo :

*To reach our objective, you will find an new implementation of Car's class in the package with new features*  

### 1) Format things!

Here, we have to implement some functions, In the the following object : 

    com.td.scala.functions.CarUtilities

You will find some functions' signatures that you have to implement according to short spec above 

     
    
### 2) HOF will help you for composition

Once you implemented whole of functions, go in Main class and implement pieces of code that correspond to each description.

## Summary

Here, we played with Hight Order function concept and composition in Scala. Those are a keys concepts in functional programming.
Shorts examples should open a new way of thinking when you will design et organise your code in your future project
