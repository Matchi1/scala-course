## 3) Car constructor

In this section, we will use others functional type: `Option`, `List`

Info: We have modified the Car's signature. The field `color: String` has been replaced by a type `Color` (we will ignore the details of its implementation for the moment).

Utility class `CarConstructor` is available in package `constructor`.

Do following points:

 - Search a car by its id (from 1 to 7), and
 - Display its color
 - Avoid any crash when Car isn't found (pattern matching, fold, etc..)

 - Now we looking for some Cars with the same color
 - Once you found some Car (or not), compute the whole number of places available
 - Avoid any crash when Car isn't found (pattern matching, fold, etc..)
