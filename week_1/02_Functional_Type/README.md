## Purpose

This exercise aims to move from object-oriented to functional.

Go to [week_1/02_Functional_Type/src/main/scala/com/td/scala/functional_types/_1/README.md](Part 1 & 2)

then to [week_1/02_Functional_Type/src/main/scala/com/td/scala/functional_types/_2/README.md](Part 3)

## Summary

In this section, you learned how to make your code more functional (immutable, without raising exceptions).
Also, you worked with some functional types that allows you to describe what you want to do instead of write it (execution flow).
