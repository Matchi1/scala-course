    # Functions

## Purpose

This exercise aims to dive in functions (simple, higher-order functions, etc)

## Instructions

*To reach our objective, you will find an new implementation of the class Car in the package with new features*

### 1) Format things!

> Implement the signatures in `com.td.scala.functions.CarUtilities`

### 2) HOF will help you for composition

> Once you've implemented all of the functions, implement the missing code that correspond to each description in class `Main`

## Summary

Here, we used Higher-Order functions and composition in Scala. Those are a keys concepts in functional programing.
These shorts examples should open a new way of thinking when you will design et organize your code in your future project.
