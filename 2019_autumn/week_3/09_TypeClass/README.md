# Type class

## Purpose

Here, we will talk about typeclass and we try to understand the mechanism
In this module you have one base code to be fill. Read instructions, it will drive you step by step.

## Todo : 

### 1) Need converter 

Based on the trait Converter, implement implicits converters. 
Converter defined an exchange between two currencies with a fixed rate (in our case).  
    
### 2) Fill Bank trait implementation

We have one trait that define the contract for a bank. 
You have to fill the implicit parameter and provide an implementation of the Bank trait (based currency of the bank, choose EUR)
   
### 3) Exchange, Exchange... 

In Main class, from your bank, make different exchange from EURO to DOLLAR, YEN, your own currency
 

## Summary

Here, we introduced the typeClass's mechanism. 
We see how typeClass will help us to extends our code based in respect of open/close paradigm
