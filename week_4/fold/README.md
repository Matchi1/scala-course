# Recursion

## Purpose

This exercise aims to put the hands on List methods

## Instructions

`com.td.scala.fold.Data`
- `trips` provides a list of trips of cyclists represented as a list of tuple(start, end)
- `names` provides a list of the cyclists names (same order than the trips)

### 1) Implement signature

> Implement thes signatures in `com.td.scala.fold.Monitor`
> Run the tests

> Use these function to complete Main class
